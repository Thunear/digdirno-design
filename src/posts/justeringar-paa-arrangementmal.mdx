Design systems are more than a component library — they're a shared language between designers and developers.

## Why We Built One

As our product portfolio grew, inconsistencies crept in. Buttons looked different across apps, spacing was unpredictable, and onboarding new team members took longer than it should.

We needed a single source of truth.

## Our Approach

We started small: **color tokens, typography, and spacing**. Instead of trying to build everything at once, we focused on the primitives that every component depends on.

### Key decisions:

- **Token-first architecture** — every visual property references a design token
- **Composition over configuration** — small, composable components beat monolithic ones
- **Documentation as a feature** — if it isn't documented, it doesn't exist

## Lessons Learned

1. Get buy-in early from both design and engineering leadership
2. Automate as much as possible — linting, visual regression tests, publishing
3. Treat the design system as a product with its own roadmap

> "A design system is a living product — it needs care, feeding, and the occasional refactor."

The journey is ongoing, but the investment has already paid dividends in consistency, speed, and team happiness.
